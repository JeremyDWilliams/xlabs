This repository is for the "Just Works ROS2 installer".

This is a colaborative group effort of xLabs to build and maintain a simple one click solution to provide ROS2, Nav2 on Humble 22.04 with Gazebo onto at least two hardware platforms. The first being a generic intel based x86 Windows system (Desktop) and a second being a common and easy to obtain single board computer (SBC) similar to a Rasberry pi.

The intent is provide the user with an easy path to get up and running with ROS2 and Nav2. Both virtually with Gazebo, and also with a real world implenatation using a desktop or SBC hardware platform.

The overiding goal is to let anyone easily install and use ROS2 without worrying about package conflicts. The two main aspects of this project are to provide a working solution based on existing frameworks wherever possible along with an active maintenance of the code as ROS2 and its various components change overtime.

A focus on 'Just Works' will be paramount, rather than always having the latest release. Stability of the solution is by far the most important aspect of this.

The details of this project are still in development and will be updated here.
